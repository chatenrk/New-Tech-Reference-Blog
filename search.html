Regardless of your local machine's operating    system, you will need to download for Linux, as that is what the    container will be running                  From the same page, now download the latest SAP Java Virtual Machine    (JVM) into the sapdownloads/ directory, again for Linux, and    specifically the . rpm component              Finally create a new file called Dockerfile in the container-scc/    directory (noting the capitalization and lack of extension on this file    name)              Into this file, copy the contents of the    Dockerfile       Build the Docker image         Build the image, and after that you can instantiate a container from    that image. In the container-scc directory (where the Dockerfile    file is located), build the image as follows in this repository                  On successful completion the cloud connector should be installed              Look for the image that's produced, with the following command           Instantiate a container     Now you have an image, it's time to instantiate a container from it. This   will have Cloud Connector running inside it. Instantiate the container as   follows          Briefly, the parameters used here do the following:            -p 8443:8443: make port 8443 in the container available on the     host machine (remember, SAP Cloud Connector listens by default on port     8443 and you want to be able to connect to it with your browser on     your host machine)             --name myscc: this gives a human-friendly name to the container     that can be used to refer to it in any subsequent commands             -d: run the container in  detached  mode, i. e. in the     background             scc: this is the name of the image from which the container is     to be created              Check that the container is running, with another Docker command          Connect to perform initial setup of the SAP Cloud Connector       Log on to the SAP Cloud Connector in your browser, and use the   administration interface to perform some initial setup, in particular,   connecting it to the SAP Cloud Platform       Open your browser and go to the SAP Cloud Connector administration UI at   https://localhost:8443. Remember that   this is only possible because, with the -p 8443:8443 parameter earlier,   you specified that port 8443 in the container (which is where SAP Cloud   Connector is actually running and listening) should be exposed to your   machine, the container's host (where Docker is running), also on port   8443.

First, so you can see for yourself what you're aiming to get to from    within the SAP Cloud Platform, and second, so you know what you're    looking for when you access that data source indirectly (through the    destination). Open up the    OData    service, taking care to specify client 002 in the URL            Create a new destination definition         Go to your  Trial Subaccount Home  page, and select the  Destinations     menu item within the  Connectivity  item               Select the  New Destination  option, and in the configuration specify    values for the appropriate parameters                         #        Property        Value                                  1        Name        shopinfo                      2        Type        HTTP                      3        Description        Virtual Event Shop Info                      4        URL        http://virtuales5:8000/sap/opu/odata/sap/EPM_REF_APPS_SHOP_SRV/                      5        Proxy Type        OnPremise                      6        Location ID        (leave blank)                      7        Authentication        Basic Authentication                      8        User        (your ES5 username)                      9        Password        (your ES5 password)                             Add the following property / value pair in the  Additional Properties  section using the  New Property  button, and then save the entire destination definition with the  Save  button                         #        Property        Value                                  1        sap-client         002                                   Deploy a simple app to test the destination connection            At this stage you have the destination definition set up. But will everything work when everything is wired up, including from the workflow definition you'll define later? It's worth testing that new destination with a small app that just routes incoming requests via that destination to the data source (the OData service in ES5) using the Connectivity service         You will do that in this step, by deploying the simplest app definition (and its corresponding manifest file), and then testing the destination via that app's routing. While you would normally deploy applications from your editor or IDE, you can actually deploy an application archive, along with its corresponding descriptor file (the  manifest ) manually from within the SAP Cloud Platform Cockpit For reference, the entire app and configuration is in the Github repo, as follows                 #      File      Description                        1      manifest. yml      the descriptor file describing how the application is to be deployed, and upon which services it relies                2      package. json      the Node. js package description for the app, describing essentially what the app relies upon (the @sap/approuter package) and how to start it up                3      xs-app. json      The approuter configuration, in the form of a single route that uses the shopinfo destination             The files package. json and xs-app. json have been bundled together into the archive file app. zip (also in the same dest-test-app ). There's also an xs-security. json file which describes how the xsuaa service should be configured, a service upon which the app relies   Download the app. zip and manifest. yml files. Download the xsuaa service parameter file xs-security. json file too   In fact, the successful operation of the app relies on not one but three services:      Authorization &amp; Trust Management (xsuaa)    Connectivity (connectivity)    Destination (destination)  Set up two of these (xsuaa and destination) manually, now, before deploying the appNavigate to the  dev  space in your Cloud Foundry (CF) organization.    Setup the services in Cloud Platform.       Next to deploy the app, navigate to dev space and select the  Applications  menu item and use the  Deploy Application  button.     For the  File Location , browse to and select the app. zip archive that you previously downloaded. Ensure that the  Use Manifest  checkbox is selected, then browse to and select the manifest. yml file that you also previously downloaded for the  Manifest Location . Then use the  Deploy  button                   Select its name ( my-dest-test ) and select the URL in the  Application Routes  section of the app's  Overview  page; the URL will contain a random string in the first part, to ensure that each of your apps deployed have unique hostnames           After authenticating with your trial user email address and password, you'll be presented with the resource you saw at the start of this exercise. But this time, you're accessing it through the SAP Cloud Platform, via the Connectivity service and a destination definition, instead of directly. Moreover, if you've set up the Cloud Connector, this access is going through that too.             Explore the Products entityset          You'll be using data from the Products entityset in the OData service you've just exposed, so use this step to explore the data in that entityset, so you're at least a little bit familiar with it                     Explore the data that is returned - you should see a list of products, with the sort of properties you'd expect from a product database, such as an ID, name, description, information about stock quantity, and so on.         If you prefer looking at JSON rather than XML, append the query parameter $format=json to the URL              "

You can nest groups inside each other and combine them with    multiplication * operator:            Attribute operators:          Attribute operators are used to modify attributes of outputted elements.     For example, in HTML and XML you can quickly add class attribute to    generated element        ID and CLASS:          In CSS, you use elem#id and elem. class notation to reach the elements    with specified id or class attributes. In Emmet, you can use the very    same syntax to add these attributes to specified element            Custom attributes:          You can use [attr] notation (as in CSS) to add custom attributes to your    element:                       You can place as many attributes as you like inside square brackets.                You don’t have to specify attribute values: td[colspan title] will produce &lt;td colspan=   title=  &gt; with tabstops inside each empty attribute (if your editor supports them).                You can use single or double quotes for quoting attribute values.                You don’t need to quote values if they don’t contain spaces: td[title=hello colspan=3] will work.             Item numbering: $:             With multiplication * operator you can repeat elements, but with $ you can number them. Place $ operator inside element’s name, attribute’s name or attribute’s value to output current number of repeated element:                     You can use multiple $ in a row to pad number with zeroes:               Text: {}:       You can use curly braces to add text to element:         Note that {text} is used and parsed as a separate element (like, div, p etc. ) but has a special meaning when written right after element. For example, a{click} and a&gt;{click} will produce the same output, but a{click}+b{here} and a&gt;{click}+b{here} won’t:    "
