Regardless of your local machine's operating    system, you will need to download for Linux, as that is what the    container will be running                  From the same page, now download the latest SAP Java Virtual Machine    (JVM) into the sapdownloads/ directory, again for Linux, and    specifically the . rpm component              Finally create a new file called Dockerfile in the container-scc/    directory (noting the capitalization and lack of extension on this file    name)              Into this file, copy the contents of the    Dockerfile       Build the Docker image         Build the image, and after that you can instantiate a container from    that image. In the container-scc directory (where the Dockerfile    file is located), build the image as follows in this repository                  On successful completion the cloud connector should be installed              Look for the image that's produced, with the following command           Instantiate a container     Now you have an image, it's time to instantiate a container from it. This   will have Cloud Connector running inside it. Instantiate the container as   follows          Briefly, the parameters used here do the following:            -p 8443:8443: make port 8443 in the container available on the     host machine (remember, SAP Cloud Connector listens by default on port     8443 and you want to be able to connect to it with your browser on     your host machine)             --name myscc: this gives a human-friendly name to the container     that can be used to refer to it in any subsequent commands             -d: run the container in  detached  mode, i. e. in the     background             scc: this is the name of the image from which the container is     to be created              Check that the container is running, with another Docker command          Connect to perform initial setup of the SAP Cloud Connector       Log on to the SAP Cloud Connector in your browser, and use the   administration interface to perform some initial setup, in particular,   connecting it to the SAP Cloud Platform       Open your browser and go to the SAP Cloud Connector administration UI at   https://localhost:8443. Remember that   this is only possible because, with the -p 8443:8443 parameter earlier,   you specified that port 8443 in the container (which is where SAP Cloud   Connector is actually running and listening) should be exposed to your   machine, the container's host (where Docker is running), also on port   8443.        If this does not work on Chrome, try running on Internet Explorer             At the  Cloud Connector Login  page, log in with the default username and   password Administrator and manage. You're then prompted to   change this password which you should do, selecting the  Save  icon on the   right hand side to proceed (leave other options as they are)          Next, you're asked to specify an initial subaccount that you want the SAP   Cloud Connector to connect to          Make the SAP backend system available     Now that the connection is established, you can define access to the   on-prem backend SAP system that the SAP Cloud Connector will facilitate       Select the  Cloud To On-Premise  item in the navigation menu on the left   hand side, and in the  Mapping Virtual To Internal System  section, create   a new system mapping entry with the  +  icon. In the dialog that follows,   you can specify the details of your backend SAP system, i. e. the ES5   system                                  Expose a set of resources in the backend system       While you've established a mapping of a virtual host (that is visible at   the SAP Cloud Platform level) to an internal (on-prem) host, there are   still no accessible resources available on that host. You must specify   these explicitly       In the new  Resources of virtuales5:8000  section that is now visible, add   a new resource entry with the  +  icon, specifying the following values   and finishing with the  Save  button\                  #      Setting      Value                        1      URL Path      /sap/opu/odata                2      Active      (checked)                3      WebSocket Upgrade      (leave unchecked)                4      Access Policy      Path and all sub-paths                     "

First, so you can see for yourself what you're aiming to get to from    within the SAP Cloud Platform, and second, so you know what you're    looking for when you access that data source indirectly (through the    destination). Open up the    OData    service, taking care to specify client 002 in the URL            Create a new destination definition:          Go to your  Trial Subaccount Home  page, and select the  Destinations     menu item within the  Connectivity  item              Select the  New Destination  option, and in the configuration specify    values for the appropriate parameters                      #      Property      Value                        1      Name      shopinfo                2      Type      HTTP                3      Description      Virtual Event Shop Info                4      URL             http://virtuales5:8000/sap/opu/odata/sap/EPM_REF_APPS_SHOP_SRV/                      5      Proxy Type      OnPremise                6      Location ID      (leave blank)                7      Authentication      Basic Authentication                8      User      (your ES5 username)                9      Password      (your ES5 password)                   Add the following property / value pair in the  Additional Properties     section using the  New Property  button, and then save the entire    destination definition with the  Save  button                      #      Property      Value                        1      sap-client      002                      Deploy a simple app to test the destination connection:          At this stage you have the destination definition set up. But will    everything work when everything is wired up, including from the workflow    definition you'll define later? It's worth testing that new destination    with a small app that just routes incoming requests via that destination    to the data source (the OData service in ES5) using the Connectivity    service           You will do that in this step, by deploying the simplest app definition    (and its corresponding manifest file), and then testing the destination    via that app's routing. While you would normally deploy applications    from your editor or IDE, you can actually deploy an application archive,    along with its corresponding descriptor file (the  manifest ) manually    from within the SAP Cloud Platform Cockpit           For reference, the entire app and configuration is in the    Github    repo, as follows                      #      File      Description                        1      manifest. yml             the descriptor file describing how the application is to be       deployed, and upon which services it relies                      2      package. json             the Node. js package description for the app, describing       essentially what the app relies upon (the       @sap/approuter package) and how to start it up                      3      xs-app. json             The approuter configuration, in the form of a single route that       uses the shopinfo destination                         The files package. json and xs-app. json have    been bundled together into the archive file app. zip (also    in the same dest-test-app ). There's also an    xs-security. json file which describes how the    xsuaa service should be configured, a service upon which    the app relies           Download the    app. zip    and    manifest. yml    files. Download the xsuaa service parameter file    xs-security. json    file too           In fact, the successful operation of the app relies on not one but three    services:           Authorization &amp; Trust Management (xsuaa)    Connectivity (connectivity)    Destination (destination)          Set up two of these (xsuaa and destination)    manually, now, before deploying the app Navigate to the  dev  space in    your Cloud Foundry (CF) organization.              Setup the services in Cloud Platform. Next to deploy the app, navigate    to dev space and select the  Applications  menu item and use the  Deploy    Application  button.           For the  File Location , browse to and select the app. zip archive that    you previously downloaded. Ensure that the  Use Manifest  checkbox is    selected, then browse to and select the manifest. yml file that you also    previously downloaded for the  Manifest Location . Then use the  Deploy     button                       Select its name ( my-dest-test ) and select the URL in the  Application    Routes  section of the app's  Overview  page; the URL will contain a    random string in the first part, to ensure that each of your apps    deployed have unique hostnames              After authenticating with your trial user email address and password,    you'll be presented with the resource you saw at the start of this    exercise. But this time, you're accessing it through the SAP Cloud    Platform, via the Connectivity service and a destination definition,    instead of directly. Moreover, if you've set up the Cloud Connector,    this access is going through that too.           Explore the Products entityset:          You'll be using data from the Products entityset in the OData service    you've just exposed, so use this step to explore the data in that    entityset, so you're at least a little bit familiar with it              Explore the data that is returned - you should see a list of products,    with the sort of properties you'd expect from a product database, such    as an ID, name, description, information about stock quantity, and so    on.           If you prefer looking at JSON rather than XML, append the query    parameter $format=json to the URL          "

You can nest groups inside each other and combine them with    multiplication * operator:            Attribute operators:          Attribute operators are used to modify attributes of outputted elements.     For example, in HTML and XML you can quickly add class attribute to    generated element        ID and CLASS:          In CSS, you use elem#id and elem. class notation to reach the elements    with specified id or class attributes. In Emmet, you can use the very    same syntax to add these attributes to specified element            Custom attributes:          You can use [attr] notation (as in CSS) to add custom attributes to your    element:                       You can place as many attributes as you like inside square brackets.                You don’t have to specify attribute values: td[colspan title] will produce &lt;td colspan=   title=  &gt; with tabstops inside each empty attribute (if your editor supports them).                You can use single or double quotes for quoting attribute values.                You don’t need to quote values if they don’t contain spaces: td[title=hello colspan=3] will work.             Item numbering: $:             With multiplication * operator you can repeat elements, but with $ you can number them. Place $ operator inside element’s name, attribute’s name or attribute’s value to output current number of repeated element:                     You can use multiple $ in a row to pad number with zeroes:               Text: {}:       You can use curly braces to add text to element:         Note that {text} is used and parsed as a separate element (like, div, p etc. ) but has a special meaning when written right after element. For example, a{click} and a&gt;{click} will produce the same output, but a{click}+b{here} and a&gt;{click}+b{here} won’t:    "
