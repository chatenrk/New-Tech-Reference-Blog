      <p>
        Before creating the destination, which is effectively a pointer to a
        data source, it's worth checking that data source manually and directly.
        First, so you can see for yourself what you're aiming to get to from
        within the SAP Cloud Platform, and second, so you know what you're
        looking for when you access that data source indirectly (through the
        destination). Open up the
        <a
          href="https://sapes5.sapdevcenter.com/sap/opu/odata/sap/EPM_REF_APPS_SHOP_SRV/?sap-client=002"
          >OData</a
        >
        service, taking care to specify client 002 in the URL

    <h1 id="testapp">Deploy a simple app to test the destination connection</h1>
    <div>
        <p>
            At this stage you have the destination definition set up. But will everything work when everything is wired up, including from the workflow definition you'll define later? It's worth testing that new destination with a small app that just routes incoming requests via that destination to the data source (the OData service in ES5) using the Connectivity service

        </p>
        <p>You will do that in this step, by deploying the simplest app definition (and its corresponding manifest file), and then testing the destination via that app's routing. While you would normally deploy applications from your editor or IDE, you can actually deploy an application archive, along with its corresponding descriptor file (the "manifest") manually from within the SAP Cloud Platform Cockpit
</p>
<p>For reference, the entire app and configuration is in the <a href="https://github.com/chatenrk/New-Tech-App-Developed/tree/master/cpDestinationTestApp">Github</a> repo, as follows
    <table class="table table-sm table-bordered">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>#</th>
            <th>File</th>
            <th>Description</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
         <tr>
            <td scope="row">1</td>
            <td>manifest.yml</td>
            <td>the descriptor file describing how the application is to be deployed, and upon which services it relies</td>
          </tr>
         <tr>
            <td scope="row">2</td>
            <td>package.json</td>
            <td>the Node.js package description for the app, describing essentially what the app relies upon (the <code>@sap/approuter</code> package) and how to start it up</td>
          </tr>
         <tr>
            <td scope="row">3</td>
            <td>xs-app.json</td>
            <td>The approuter configuration, in the form of a single route that uses the <code>shopinfo</code> destination </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
</p>
<p>The files <code>package.json</code> and <code>xs-app.json</code> have been bundled together into the archive file <code>app.zip</code> (also in the same <code>dest-test-app</code> ). There's also an <code>xs-security.json</code> file which describes how the <code>xsuaa</code> service should be configured, a service upon which the app relies</p>
<p>
    Download the <a href="https://github.com/chatenrk/New-Tech-App-Developed/blob/master/cpDestinationTestApp/app.zip">app.zip</a> and <a href="https://github.com/chatenrk/New-Tech-App-Developed/blob/master/cpDestinationTestApp/manifest.yml">manifest.yml</a> files. Download the <code>xsuaa</code> service parameter file <a href="https://github.com/chatenrk/New-Tech-App-Developed/blob/master/cpDestinationTestApp/xs-security.json">xs-security.json</a> file too
</p>

<p>
    In fact, the successful operation of the app relies on not one but three services:

    <ul>
        <li>Authorization & Trust Management (<code>xsuaa</code>)</li>
        <li>Connectivity (<code>connectivity</code>)</li>
        <li>Destination (<code>destination</code>)</li>
    </ul>

Set up two of these (<code>xsuaa</code> and <code>destination</code>) manually, now, before deploying the app

Navigate to the "dev" space in your Cloud Foundry (CF) organization.

      Setup the services in Cloud Platform.
      
      Next to deploy the app, navigate to dev space and select the "Applications" menu item and use the "Deploy Application" button. 
</p><p>
      For the "File Location", browse to and select the app.zip archive that you previously downloaded. Ensure that the "Use Manifest" checkbox is selected, then browse to and select the manifest.yml file that you also previously downloaded for the "Manifest Location". Then use the "Deploy" button

    Select its name ("my-dest-test") and select the URL in the "Application Routes" section of the app's "Overview" page; the URL will contain a random string in the first part, to ensure that each of your apps deployed have unique hostnames

      After authenticating with your trial user email address and password, you'll be presented with the resource you saw at the start of this exercise. But this time, you're accessing it through the SAP Cloud Platform, via the Connectivity service and a destination definition, instead of directly. Moreover, if you've set up the Cloud Connector, this access is going through that too.

        Explore the data that is returned - you should see a list of products, with the sort of properties you'd expect from a product database, such as an ID, name, description, information about stock quantity, and so on.
        
        If you prefer looking at JSON rather than XML, append the query parameter $format=json to the URL
